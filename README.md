# Moments
Helps you save time by saving the time of your highlights in videos while recording
When you start recording your gameplay start the app alongside the recording and whenever
you feel like there was a valuable moment in your gameplay hit F9 (will be customizeable later)
and it will be saved. Then you will be able to find the time stamps of every session in txt files.
